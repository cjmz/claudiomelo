# About Me

Hi! 👋 I'm **Claudio Melo**, a Data Engineer passionate about building robust, scalable, and high-performance data systems.

## Technical Expertise

I primarily work with:

- **Apache Spark** - Optimization, performance tuning, and distributed job architecture

## Philosophy

I believe that **good data engineers** don't just make code work, they:

- ✅ Write code that others can maintain
- ✅ Document the "why", not just the "how"
- ✅ Share knowledge with the community
