# About Me

I'm **Claudio Melo**, a software and data engineer passionate about building systems that work at scale.

## What I Do

I focus on the intersection of software engineering and data systems:

- **Distributed Systems** - Building and optimizing large-scale data processing systems
- **Apache Spark** - Performance tuning, architecture, and best practices
- **Data Architecture** - Designing robust data platforms and pipelines
- **Software Engineering** - Writing maintainable, performant code
- **System Design** - Trade-offs, scalability, and reliability patterns

## Philosophy

I believe that good engineering is about:

- ✅ Understanding trade-offs deeply before making decisions
- ✅ Writing code that communicates intent clearly
- ✅ Documenting the reasoning behind architectural choices
- ✅ Learning continuously and sharing knowledge
- ✅ Building systems that are simple, but not simplistic

## About This Blog

This blog explores:

- 📚 **Fundamental principles** that transcend specific technologies
- 🎯 **System design patterns** and architectural decisions
- ⚖️ **Trade-offs** in building real-world systems
- 🚀 **Practical implementations** with working code
- 🧠 **Mental models** for solving complex problems

I write about topics like distributed data processing, system performance, software architecture, and the principles that make systems reliable and maintainable.
