## From Software Engineer to Data Engineering Enthusiast

Having worked as a software engineer since 2012, I've gained experience across various domains including WordPress, Laravel, Ruby on Rails, backend, and frontend development. This year, I embarked on a new and exciting challenge as a backend software engineer at a prominent South American tech company, collaborating with a team of highly experienced professionals. The project, centered around a "feature store"—a concept new to me before joining—has presented novel challenges.

For those unfamiliar with feature stores, let's first clarify what a feature is. A feature is a characteristic that describes an object, typically the subject of your study. These features are then utilized to train machine learning models or to make predictions based on them.

It is an extremely important step in machine learning feature engineering, crucial for the successful operation of the entire process.

This exposure and the motivation to deepen my understanding of data engineering have inspired me to initiate a personal project focused on a data engineering career transition. To further this goal, I recently enrolled in a postgraduate program with a strong foundation in statistics. I'm thoroughly enjoying this course and am optimistic about the growing market for data engineering, a trend evident in Google's search data.

My pursuit of a data science analytics course, grounded in statistical principles, stems from a desire to comprehend the entire data science ecosystem. My goal is to specialize in data engineering, and understanding the broader field, including its statistical foundations, is crucial for this. In an era where large language models are increasingly capable of generating code, a solid knowledge base, particularly in statistics, becomes even more essential.

Statistical thinking has offered surprising insights, such as methods to enhance presentations and critical analysis skills. Furthermore, I've observed striking parallels between software engineering and data science learning, particularly in their foundational elements. Just as algorithms and data structures were fundamental when I began learning software development, they form the bedrock of many data science concepts, like trees.
